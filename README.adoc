A guide on how to create and use regular expressions – by example 🚀.

[NOTE]
====
The link:{uri_repo_gitlab}[main repo is on gitlab], and therefore, suggestions, issues, etc. should happen there.
The link:{uri_repo_github}[github repo] is only a mirror.

[NOTE]
====
Github doesn't do nice rendering of Asciidoctor (`.adoc`) files.
Gitlab does a much better job at this.
You are advised to read this text link:{uri_repo_gitlab}[there].
